What is the sufficient condition of the length of the trajectory to check the stability or instability of A?

1. First consider fully observed LTI system without noise: x_{t+1} =  A x_{t}
   
    Jordan Block has some very strange behaviors
   
   Two cases: diagonalizable and non-diagonalizable
   
2. Fully observed LTI system with noise: x_{t+1} =  A x_{t} + w_t
   
   w_t could be Gaussian noise or bounded noise. We also should be careful with Jordan block.
   
3. Many other cases...
