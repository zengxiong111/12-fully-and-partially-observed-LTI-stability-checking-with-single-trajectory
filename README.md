1. First consider fully observed LTI system without noise: x_{t+1} =  A x_{t}
    Jordan block has some very strange behaviors
   Two cases: diagonalizable and non-diagonalizable
2. Fully observed LTI system with noise: x_{t+1} =  A x_{t} + w_t
   w_t could be Gaussian noise or bounded noise. We also should be careful with Jordan block.
3. Many other cases
